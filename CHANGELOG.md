# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-03-25

Initial release. Pure Ruby implementation of ZMTP 3.1 (ZeroMQ) using Async.

### Socket types

- REQ, REP, DEALER, ROUTER
- PUB, SUB, XPUB, XSUB
- PUSH, PULL
- PAIR

### Transports

- TCP (with ephemeral port support and IPv6)
- IPC (Unix domain sockets, including Linux abstract namespace)
- inproc (in-process, lock-free direct pipes)

### Features

- Buffered I/O via io-stream (read-ahead buffering, automatic TCP_NODELAY)
- Heartbeat (PING/PONG) with configurable interval and timeout
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Per-socket send/receive HWM (high-water mark)
- Linger on close (drain send queue before closing)
- `max_message_size` enforcement
- `connect_timeout` for TCP
- Works inside Async reactors or standalone (shared IO thread)
- Optional CURVE encryption via the [omq-curve](https://github.com/paddor/omq-curve) gem
